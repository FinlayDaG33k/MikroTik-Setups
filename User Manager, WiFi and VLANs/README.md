# User Manager, WiFi and VLANs

Setup WiFi access using User Manager and implement VLAN separation.  
Useful if you want to have specific users' their WiFi going to specific VLANs.

Reasons to use this setup:

- You want to isolate certain users without making 1337666 separate SSIDs.
- You want to easily see which devices belongs to which person.
- You want to set time limits for specific users (eg. people you only ever see in the weekends).

Reasons to not use this setup:

- You are the only one using your network.
- You only want to isolate IoT or guest devices.
- You run silly consumer electronics that do not support WPA(2)-EAP (eg. a Nintendo Switch or a printer).

**NOTE**: This setup only handles setting up User Manager, your WiFi and assigning VLANs to users.  
It does not handle setting up WiFi, CAPsMAN or VLANs on routers and switches.
